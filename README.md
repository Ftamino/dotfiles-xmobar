# Info

This is my current setup which is using xmonad as a wm. You are able to click the workspace names btw üòé. A list of keybinds is WIP (Open it if installed with Mod+F12). Feel free to fork it and do sth cool out of it, you dont need to give credits but I would be happy about it. üòÅ

## Change Themes

To change Themes use the Python Programm. If the dotfiles are installed use F12 on your keyboard. A simple python3 ./configuration.py should also do it. Changing the Themes for GTK will come in the Programm soon, but its also possible to cahange it thorugh lxapperance.

## Make Themes

To make your own theme just go into .xmonad/lib/colors and copy one of the .hs files. Give it a new name and change in line 1 behind "Colors." the eg Standart to the name of your file. In line five to the same. Change the scheme in xmonad.hs in the imports section by changing the argument import Colors.Standart to the name of yours.
 
## Make Material You Themes

If you ever used a Android 12 phone you probably know that there is that system called material you which changes all the system colors to some of your background. To do that open the configuration (Meta/Windows Key+F12) go to Change Color Scheme - Material You, and you are done. This System is still not ready and im working on improving it. If you want you can help making the script better or modify it for your dotfiles. 
 
# Installing 
Disclaimer: The script is not perfect and my not work for everyone or destroy sth. 

## Arch, Debian and Arch/Debian based 
 1. Install dependences
```
sudo apt install git whiptail
```
 2. Download the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Ftamino/dotfiles.git dotfiles
```
 3. Go into the downloaded dir
```
cd dotfiles
```
 4. Give the script permissions 
```
chmod +x ./install.sh
```
 5. Run it
```
./install.sh
```
6. To get fish as the default shell use
```
sudo usermod -s yourname /bin/fish
```

 Done
 
## Others:
 1. Use your package manager to install dependences (if u dont use the flatpak of flameshot you have to change the hotkey action for it in the xmonad config)
 ```
 xmonad xmobar neofetch lxpolkit dunst rofi picom copyq volumeicon nitrogen emacs kitty git flameshot arandr
 ```
 2. Download the repo
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/Ftamino/dotfiles.git dotfiles
 ```
 3. Find out where the files need to go (look at the install script)
 
 ## Troubleshooting: 
 
 1. Trayer is on the wrong monitor: Go to line 271 in xmonad.hs and change --monitor 2 to 1 (depends on how many screens you have)
 
 2. Open a issue if sth went wrong and i will add it here (;
