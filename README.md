## Themeing

To change Themes use the Python Programm. A simple python3 ./configuration.py should do it.
To make your own theme just go into .xmonad/lib/colors and copy one of the .hs files. Give it a new name and change in line 1 behind "Colors." the eg Standart to the name of your file. In line five to the same. Change the scheme in xmonad.hs in the imports section by changing the argument import Colors.Standart to the name of yours.
